# Curiosity_Temp_Data
Here, I've trained four different machine learning models on ground temperatures from Mars as observed by the Curiosity rover. The dataset was obtained through Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/mars-rover-environmental-monitoring-station) and cleaned for analysis. This involved stripping nonnumeric characters from the Sol number column in order to get a usable time measurement as well as removing any null values and extreme outliers.  
With Sol number standing in for the date and air temperature as inputs, I chose to try Bayesian ridge regression, Gaussian regression, kernel ridge regression, and decision trees. 
Of them all, the decision tree regression seems to be the most consistently accurate, while the kernel ridge regression regretfully missed the mark quite often.
